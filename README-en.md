## Project Introduction

When we maintain the website, we may occasionally make some relatively simple mistakes, such as forgetting to replace the domain name certificate and making the website inaccessible. However, when we remembered and replaced the certificate, the website became inaccessible because some parsing was missed. These are painful mistakes.

This project aims to enable you to easily grasp the certificate information for each domain name resolution, so that when changing certificates, you will not miss any resolution.

Supports multiple DNS providers, and supports single provider multi account management, while also supporting custom configuration files to obtain certificate information.

## How to use

You can download the binary directly from the [Release](https://github.com/eryajf/cloud_dns_exporter/releases) release page, then change the configuration file and run it directly.

The default port listening is `21798` . Why choose this port? Because the dashboard ID corresponding to the project in Grafana is [21798](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/21798-cloud-dns-record-info/)„ÄÇ

You can also choose to use Docker deployment. Configure `config.yaml` locally when deploying, and then override the default in the container by mounting (`-v ./config.yaml:/app/config.yaml`) when running. Just configure it.

Image Address Ôºö
- Abroad: `eryajf/cloud_dns_exporter`
- Domestic: `registry.cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/eryajf/cloud_dns_exporter`

The current application also provides the `-v` parameter, which is used to print the currently used version information.

## Quick Experience

This project provides a `docker-compose.yml` configuration file for quick experience. Before starting, please configure your DNS service provider's `AK/SK` related information in 'docker-compose.yml' and ensure that your `docker-compose` version is not lower than [2.23.0](https://github.com/compose-spec/compose-spec/pull/429)„ÄÇ

Then execute the following command in the directory where `docker-compose.yml` is located:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

`docker-compose.yml` Three containers are defined in the document, namely:
- `cloud_dns_exporter`: Used to obtain domain name and resolution/certificate information
- `grafana`: Used to display domain name and resolution/certificate information
- `prometheus`: Used for persistent storage of domain names and resolution/certificate information

After starting with `docker - compose.yml`, access `Grafana` through http://localhost:3000 and log in using the default username and password `admin/admin`.

Add a `Prometheus` type data source to `Grafana` with the address `http://prometheus:9090`, and then save it. Then import `Grafana Dashboard 21798`, select the `prometheus` data source just added as the data source, and you can see the `UI` display effect.

## Some Attention

- In order to improve the efficiency when requesting indicator data, the project is designed to cache the data in advance through scheduled tasks. By default, the domain name and resolution record information is 30s/time, and the certificate information is obtained once every morning. If you want to get it again, just restart the application.
- Obtaining the certificate information of the parsing records will be limited by different network access scenarios, so please deploy this program in a place where all parsing records can be accessed as much as possible.
- Many domain name certificates may not match the domain name. This is because the certificate information corresponding to 443 monitored by the load service is obtained. You can choose to ignore or process it according to your own situation.
- Because domain name registration and resolution management may not be under the same cloud account, there may be cases where the domain name creation time and expiration time labels in the `domain_list` indicator are empty.

> If you find that the certificate is obtained incorrectly or incorrectly, please submit an issue for communication.

## Indicator Description

The indicators provided by this project include the following:

| NAME               | Description                 |
| ------------------ | -------------------- |
| `domain_list`      | Domain Name List             |
| `record_list`      | Domain name resolution record list     |
| `record_cert_info` | Parse record certificate information list |

## Other instructions

- If you think the project is good, please make a small gesture ‚≠êÔ∏èstar‚≠êÔ∏è!
- If you have other ideas or needs, please feel free to communicate in the issue!
- New DNS service providers are especially welcome to contribute. The scenarios I encountered are not comprehensive and everyone needs to work together to improve the project. I've put a lot of effort into making it very easy to extend the project with a new module, so go ahead and do it.
